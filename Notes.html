<li><strong>Formation of terrestrial magma ocean</strong>: Extensive melting lead to the formation of a terrestrial magma ocean during late accretion history</li>
<li><strong>Melting may have facilitated Core Formation</strong>: It is possible that during the early magma ocean stage, the Earth differentiated into an outer Silicate Mantle and an Inner Metallic Core</li>
<li><strong>Moon formed through a giant impact</strong>: A planetesimal of mass ~10-15% of the Earth collided with Earth after core formation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="formation-of-moon">Formation of Moon</h2>
<ul>
<li>Basalt samples collected from Moon have unusually low Fe concentration
<ul>
<li>Primtive Chondrules ~ 27%</li>
<li>Whole Earth ~ 34%</li>
<li>Moon ~ 13%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some iron is probably located in the core</li>
<li>More refractory lithophile elements; <strong>Al</strong> is more on the Moon.</li>
<li>Oxygen isotopic composition of Earth and Moon are identical</li>
<li><code>Siderophile</code> elements are those which have a chemical affinity for metallic Iron
<ul>
<li>Siderophile element patterns for the silicate moon are similar to the terrestrial pattern for some elements, but <strong>strongly depleted</strong> for others
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DS3Gc8l.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These chemical trends suggest that the <em>Moon may have formed from an already differentiated body</em>, and was further depleted during lunar core formation.</p>
<p>Computational Solutions indicate that an <strong>Impactor</strong> (with a mass around 10% that of Earth) collided at an oblique angle with an almost fully formed Earth to form an iron-poor Moon.</p>

<h3 id="timing-of-core-formation">Timing of Core Formation</h3>
<ul>
<li>We use the Hf-W isotopic system</li>
<li>Hf-182 decays to W-182 with a half life of 9 Ma (after 50 Ma this Hf-W chronometer is dead)</li>
<li><strong>Hf - Lithophile - Prefers to remain in the Silicate Mantle</strong></li>
<li><strong>W - Siderophile - Prefers to concentrate in the Metallic Core</strong></li>
<li>Earth's mantle has an excess W-182 relative to the chondritic value, which indicates that the Earth's core formed during the lifetime of Hf-182</li>
<li>Recent studies indicate that the bulk of the silicate metal separation was complete before the first 30 Ma</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mechanism-of-the-core-formation">Mechanism of the Core Formation</h3>
<h4 id="thermal-constraints">Thermal Constraints</h4>
<ul>
<li>The most important source of heat during the early stages of planetary accretion was from the <strong>decay of short lived isotopes</strong>, in particular Al-26 (half life: 0.7 Ma)</li>
<li>Later in the history of planetary accretion, <strong>impact melting</strong> became a more important source of thermal energy, leading to the creation of magma oceans.</li>
<li>The impact resulting the formation of Moon probably lead to widespread melting at about 30 Ma</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="geochemical-constraints">Geochemical Constraints</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Siderophile elements are expected to be found in the Core, and indeed the Mantle shows depletion in siderophile elements compared to the chondritic concentrations in meteorites</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, Calculations predict an even greater depletion. So, now we have the <em>Excess Siderophile Problem</em> in the Mantle
This was initially observed for Ni and Co, and subsequently extended to other siderophile elements</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="models-of-core-formation">Models of Core Formation</h3>
<h4 id="1-low-pressure-core-segregation-model">1. Low Pressure Core Segregation Model</h4>
<ul>
<li>Core Formation began when the Earth was 10% formed</li>
<li>Protoplanets already had formed cores. On impact, these cores merged without fully equilibrating with the silicate mantle</li>
<li>Incomplete scavenging of siderophile elements from the mantle lead to the Excess Siderophile Problem</li>
</ul>
<p>Computation Modeling shows that when there is an impact between bodies with existing metallic cores there will be homogenization of silicate and melt and the core will re-equilibrate within a magma ocean.</p>
<h4 id="2-the-late-veneer-model">2. The &quot;Late Veneer&quot; Model</h4>
<ul>
<li>There was an initial major accretion during which the core formed and the siderophile elements were removed from the mantle to the core</li>
<li>This was followed by a late stage of accretion during which more oxidizing elements were added to the Earth and these contributed moderately to the siderophile element budget of the mantle</li>
<li>Finally, a late veneer was added to the Earth representing ~1% of the Earth's mass. Most of the mantle's highly siderophile element content was added at this stage</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-high-pressure-core-segregation-model">3. High Pressure Core Segregation Model</h4>
<ul>
<li>Most favoured solution to explain Core Formation and the Excess Siderophile Problem</li>
<li>Silicate-metal equilibration occured at high pressure in a deep magma ocean. Experimental studies show that metal-silicate partition coefficients are greatly reduced at elevated temperature and pressure
<ul>
<li>For example, Ni and Co become less siderophile in nature at high pressure and temperature</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This model also explains the partitioning of the lighter elements into the core.
<ul>
<li>Solubility of Silicon increases in liquid Iron at high pressure</li>

<h4 id="evidence">Evidence</h4>
<p><strong>1. Magnetic Field</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rotating, conducting field can generate and sustain a magnetic field</li>
<li>Flowing stream of molten iron causes an electric current to flow in the outer core, which in turn generates a magnetic field</li>
<li>Magnetic field of Earth reverses its polarity on a random timescale of thousands of years [Reversal in Sun happen every 7-15 years]</li>
<li>When lava cools, the minerals with magnetic property preserve the <strong>paleo-magnetic</strong> signatures. Magnetic inclination in a mineral varies with its latitude and hence, is used to infer its <strong>paleo-latitude</strong>.</li>
