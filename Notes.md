# Introduction and Nucleosynthesis

- **System**: An entity made up of different parts (called components) working together as a whole

- **Reservoir**: A part of a system containing a defined amount of material

- **Flux**: The amount of energy or matter that is transferred into/out of a reservoir in unit time

    aka *Mass Transfer*

    System reaches Steady State when inflow and outflow are balanced

- **Residence Time**: The average length of time a substance spends within a reservoir in steady state in relation to abundance of that substance


## Spheres 

- **Atmosphere**: Thin layer of gases surrounding Earth’s surface
- **Hydrosphere**: Contains Earth’s water
- **Geosphere**: The solid Earth
- **Biosphere**: Composed of the living entities on Earth

___

**Exogenic Cycles** - Operate at the Earth's Surface

- Analysis of Earth Formation can be done using Meteorites

### Meteorites
Extra-terrestrial material that penetrates Earth Atmosphere and reaches the surface


They are fragment of asteroids


**Falls** - Meteorites recovered after an observed fall
**Finds** - Meterites which cannot be definitely associated with observed falls



Three types:
1) Stony
2) Iron - has chondrules and metal grains
3) Stony-Iron 


#### Identifying a Meteorite
- Heavy due to presence of high amounts of Fe and Ni
- Magnetic 
- Irregular shape
- Fusing coating: A thin layer of dark glass

___

## Big Bang and Solar System

- No elements heavier than He were produced in significant quantities in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
- The universe is composed of 28% by mass He-4, and 72% H
- Over 99% of the atoms in the Sun are H and He and are believed to have been formed during the origin of the Universe
- Element formation occured over a 15 minute time during which the temperature dropped from an extremely high values to less than about 10^9 K
- After this brief period, the universe became too cool and not hot and dense enough for nuclear reactions to occur
- Heavier elements formed by **s and r capture** processes
- In the universe, elements with integral multiples of 4 nucleons are more common

### Processes in Solar System

- **Nuclear Reactions** - To produce elements
- **Gravitational Collapse** - To produce stars and proto-planetary systems
- **Condensation** - To produce solid grains
- **Accretion** - To accumulate grains into planets

### Stars

- `Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram` - Luminosity vs Effective Temperature 
  - Majority of the Stars (including Sun) are found in a region called the `Main Sequence`
  - The hotter a Main Sequence Star is, the more luminous it is. This Main Sequence forms a long band along the diagonal of the HR Diagram
  - Stars spend most of their lives in the Main Sequence
- Stars also have different **Spectral Types** according to their temperature: O, B, A, F, G, K, M (high to low temperatures). [*Oscar, Bring A Fully Grown Kangaroo, My Recipe Needs Some] 
  - Each spectral type is further divided into 10 subdivisions from 0 to 9 (hotter to cooler)
  - Sun belongs to G5 type
- Nuclear Fusion of H to He requires temperatures of the order of **10^7 K**
  - If a star is massive enough, He fusion into Be will initiate
  - He-4 + He-4 -> Be-8
  - Be-8 + He-4 -> C-12 + Gamma
  - CNO Cycles also occur. They are dominant in Stars with greater than 1.3 Solar Mass

# Earth Differentiation

The Earth formed through Planetary Accretion

- **Chondritic Composition**: Identical to that of primitive meteorites
- **Experience one or more giant impacts**: Giant impact leading to planet-wide melting in its early history
- **Formation of terrestrial magma ocean**: Extensive melting lead to the formation of a terrestrial magma ocean during late accretion history
- **Melting may have facilitated Core Formation**: It is possible that during the early magma ocean stage, the Earth differentiated into an outer Silicate Mantle and an Inner Metallic Core 
- **Moon formed through a giant impact**: A planetesimal of mass ~10-15% of the Earth collided with Earth after core formation

## Formation of Moon

- Basalt samples collected from Moon have unusually low Fe concentration
  - Primtive Chondrules ~ 27%
  - Whole Earth ~ 34%
  - Moon ~ 13%
- Some iron is probably located in the core
- More refractory lithophile elements; **Al** is more on the Moon.
- Oxygen isotopic composition of Earth and Moon are identical
- `Siderophile` elements are those which have a chemical affinity for metallic Iron
  - Siderophile element patterns for the silicate moon are similar to the terrestrial pattern for some elements, but **strongly depleted** for others
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/DS3Gc8l.png)
  
These chemical trends suggest that the *Moon may have formed from an already differentiated body*, and was further depleted during lunar core formation.

Computational Solutions indicate that an **Impactor** (with a mass around 10% that of Earth) collided at an oblique angle with an almost fully formed Earth to form an iron-poor Moon.

## Formation of Earth's Core

- Earth has a 
  - **Outer Core**: Liquid Fe-Ni-S alloy
  - **Inner Core**: Solid Fe-Ni alloy
- Temperatures at
  - Top of Core: 3500-4500 K
  - Center of Earth: 5000-6000 K
  - 

__


- Mismatch of about 10% between measured density of the Earth's Outer Core and predicted density for an Fe-Ni alloy
  - Can be attributed to presence of light impurities in the Outer Core

| Light Element | Approximate (wt %) | Evidence |
| :------------- | :------------------------- | :-------- |
| Sulfur | < 6% | S is commonly found in Fe meteorites |
| Oxygen | > 1% | High solubility of O in Fe metal |
| Silicon | 5-7 % | High pressure-progressive oxidation accretion|
| Potassium | 250 ppm (could account for 20% of the heat production in the core) | K and Na concentrations in the silicate earth is ~20% less than in primitive chondrites. Either, lost during the accretion/present in the outer core as impurity |
| Carbon | ~ 1% | Stable as Fe3C |


### Timing of Core Formation 

- We use the Hf-W isotopic system
- Hf-182 decays to W-182 with a half life of 9 Ma (after 50 Ma this Hf-W chronometer is dead)
- **Hf - Lithophile - Prefers to remain in the Silicate Mantle**
- **W - Siderophile - Prefers to concentrate in the Metallic Core**
- Earth's mantle has an excess W-182 relative to the chondritic value, which indicates that the Earth's core formed during the lifetime of Hf-182
- Recent studies indicate that the bulk of the silicate metal separation was complete before the first 30 Ma

### Mechanism of the Core Formation

#### Thermal Constraints
- The most important source of heat during the early stages of planetary accretion was from the **decay of short lived isotopes**, in particular Al-26 (half life: 0.7 Ma)
- Later in the history of planetary accretion, **impact melting** became a more important source of thermal energy, leading to the creation of magma oceans.
- The impact resulting the formation of Moon probably lead to widespread melting at about 30 Ma

#### Geochemical Constraints

- Siderophile elements are expected to be found in the Core, and indeed the Mantle shows depletion in siderophile elements compared to the chondritic concentrations in meteorites
- However, Calculations predict an even greater depletion. So, now we have the *Excess Siderophile Problem* in the Mantle
    This was initially observed for Ni and Co, and subsequently extended to other siderophile elements

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/mW9GR2P.png)


### Models of Core Formation

#### 1. Low Pressure Core Segregation Model

- Core Formation began when the Earth was 10% formed
- Protoplanets already had formed cores. On impact, these cores merged without fully equilibrating with the silicate mantle
- Incomplete scavenging of siderophile elements from the mantle lead to the Excess Siderophile Problem

Computation Modeling shows that when there is an impact between bodies with existing metallic cores there will be homogenization of silicate and melt and the core will re-equilibrate within a magma ocean.

#### 2. The "Late Veneer" Model

- There was an initial major accretion during which the core formed and the siderophile elements were removed from the mantle to the core
- This was followed by a late stage of accretion during which more oxidizing elements were added to the Earth and these contributed moderately to the siderophile element budget of the mantle 
- Finally, a late veneer was added to the Earth representing ~1% of the Earth's mass. Most of the mantle's highly siderophile element content was added at this stage

#### 3. High Pressure Core Segregation Model

- Most favoured solution to explain Core Formation and the Excess Siderophile Problem 
- Silicate-metal equilibration occured at high pressure in a deep magma ocean. Experimental studies show that metal-silicate partition coefficients are greatly reduced at elevated temperature and pressure
  - For example, Ni and Co become less siderophile in nature at high pressure and temperature
- This model also explains the partitioning of the lighter elements into the core. 
  - Solubility of Silicon increases in liquid Iron at high pressure

## Geologic Time Scales

## Crust

- Earth's Crust occupies 
  - 41.2% of Surface Area
  - 0.35% of Total Mass 
- `Shield`: A large area of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks that form a tectonically stable area (E.g. Dharwar)
- `Orogeny`: Tectonically active area (E.g. Himalaya)
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/w7v3Nm7.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/8AE80j8.png)


- **Continental Crust** - Granitic Rock - 2.7 g/cc
  - Seven Elements: O and Si (72%), Al, Fe, Ca, Mg and Na constitutes 99% of the crust
- **Oceanic Crust** - Basaltic Rock - 3.0 g/cc
- `Asthenosphere` is the plastic-like Upper Mantle

___

# Tectonic Cycle


## Evidence of Crustal Movement

- Deformed rock layers indicate movement of continental crust
- `Strata`: Formation of rocks in horizontal layers on Earth's Surface
- **Lateral Forces** on crust fold strata either upward or downward
  - `Anticline`: Arch-like formation
  - `Syncline`: Bowl-like formation
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/T74CMit.png)
- Three types of Rocks
  1. `Tilted Rocks`
  2. `Folded Rocks` - Large crack in the rocks
  3. `Fault Rocks` - Fractured Rocks because of strata moving upward/downward/along the fault line
- `Isostasy`: The state of gravitational equilibrium between Earth's Crust (Lithosphere) and the Mantle such that the Crust *floats* at an elevation that depends on its thickness and density
- If weight is added to one part of the the Crust, it becomes heavier and will sink into the Mantle 

## Plate Interactions

- `Subdction`: Locations where slabs of Lithosphere capped by oceanic crust are sinking into the Asthenosphere along the downgoing limbs of Mantle convection cells
- **Plate Boundaries/Margins**: Interaction between plates occur along their edges
    - `Divergent Plate Margins`: Two plates move apart
    - `Convergent Plate Margins`: Two plates move towards each other
    - `Transform Plate Margins`: Two plate slide past each other
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/RBf0dTS.png)

## The Tectonic Cycle

Some reasons and phenomena which may show evidence of Tectonic Cycles:
- Presence of fossil seashells high in the mountains
- Parallel shapes of the Atlantic coastlines of Africa and South America, and landscapes match up from one continent to another across the oceans

### Continental Drift Hypothesis

All of the world's landmasses were together in a single huge continent, which somehow disrupted and fragments slowly drifted to their present positions

#### Evidence

**1. Magnetic Field**

- Rotating, conducting field can generate and sustain a magnetic field
- Flowing stream of molten iron causes an electric current to flow in the outer core, which in turn generates a magnetic field
- Magnetic field of Earth reverses its polarity on a random timescale of thousands of years [Reversal in Sun happen every 7-15 years]
- When lava cools, the minerals with magnetic property preserve the **paleo-magnetic** signatures. Magnetic inclination in a mineral varies with its latitude and hence, is used to infer its **paleo-latitude**. 

**2. Seafloor Spreading**

![](https://i.imgur.com/328fTNh.png)

### Subduction Zone

![](https://i.imgur.com/xeetWrw.png)


### Ocean Basins

#### Ocean Formation - Rifting of Crust

Continental masses act like thermal blanket and slowly heat up from below

These are formed from Divergent Margins

![](https://i.imgur.com/NMfg9d9.png)

#### Closure of Ocean Basin - Continental Collision

Oceanic Crust is denser than Continental Crust. When a Continental Crust meets a plate capped with Oceanic Crust, the Continental Crust will ride up and the Oceanic Plate will undergo subduction.

These are formed from Convergent Margins

![](https://i.imgur.com/PFAXLDX.png)


#### Wilson Cycle

Rifting and opening of a new ocean -> Widening into a mature ocean -> Convergence and recycling of oceanic crust in a subduction zone -> Eventual disappearance of ocean basin

### Continents

- Continental Mass was present by the end of the Hadean, continued to grow through the Archean and reached 80-90% of today's continental mass by 2.5 Ga
- During early earth, heat flow from the interior must have been (3 times) higher than it is today -> Thinner Lithosphere and vigorous Mantle Convection
- Continuous Magma rising, remelting, mixing -> Eventually the Lithosphere would have begun to cool and thicken

#### Crust-Mantle Evolution with Time

- Sm and Nd are rare earth elements. 

- Sm-147 decays to Nd-143 with a half life of 106 Ga.

- Deviations in measured Nd-143 / Nd-144 from the chondritic composition is expressed in parts per 10^4 as:

![](https://i.imgur.com/H7MwUal.png)

- Both Nd and parent Sm are incompatible elements and prefer to enter the melt phase than remaining in the mantle residue.
- Relatively, Nd has a stronger preference to enter the melt than Sm.
- So, melt-depleted mantle becomes more depleted in Nd and has elevated Sm/Nd ratio

## Supercontinents

| Supercontinent | Age (Ma) |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Columbia | 1,820 - 1,350 |
| Rodinia | 1,130 - 750 |
| Gondwana | 596 - 578 |
| Pangaea | 336 - 173 |

![](https://i.imgur.com/ogLz8Yy.png)

Supercontinent and Atmospheric Oxygen Level

![](https://i.imgur.com/49y7vGp.png)


- Oxygen levels of Archaean were negligible and now they are 21%. It is thought that the Earth's Oxygen content has risen in stages: 6-7 steps that are closely timed to the development of the Supercontinents:
  1. Continents collide
  2. Supermountains form
  3. Erosion of supermountains
  4. Large quantities of minerals and nutrients wash out to open ocean
  5. Explosion of marine algae life (partly due to the above eroded nutrients into the oceans)
  6. Mass amounts of oxygen produced during photosynthesis

## Identifying Minerals

- **Colors** 
  - Least useful property   
  - ![](https://i.imgur.com/XKWp5Zp.png)
- **Luster** 
  - | Luster | Characteristics |
    | ------ | --------------- |
    | Metallic | Strong reflections produced by opaque substances |
    | Vitreous | Bright, as in glass |
    | Resinous | Characteristic of resins, as in amber |
    | Greasy | The appearance of being coated with an oily substance |
    | Pearly | The whitish iridescence of fibrous materials such as silk |
    | Adamantine | The brilliant luster of diamond and similar minerals |
- **Streak**
  - Color of a mineral powder
  - E.g. Haematite may be black, red or brown, but always leaves a brown streak when scratched along a ceramic plate
- **Breakage/Cleavage Pattern**
  - Tendency of a mineral to separate along planes of weakness
  - ![](https://i.imgur.com/qdOUW0D.png)
  - **Fracture**: No planes of weakness so the mineral breaks along irregular surface, E.g. Glass

Summary

| Property | Relation to Composition and Crystal Structure |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Hardness | Strong chemical bonds give high hardness. Covalently bonded minerals are generally harder than ionically bonded minerals. |
| Cleavage | Cleavage is poor if bonds in a crystal structure are strong, good if bonds are weak. Covalent bonds generally give poor or no cleavage. Ionic bonds are weak and so give excellent cleavage. |
| Fracture | Type is related to distribution of bond strengths across irregular surfaces other than cleavage planes |
| Luster | Tends to be glassy for ionically bonded crystals, more variable for covalently bonded crystals. |
| Color | Determined by kinds of atoms or ions and trace impurities. Many locally bonded ionic crystals are colorless. Iron tends to color strongly. |
| Streak | Color of fine powder is more characteristic than that of massive mineral because of uniformly small size of grains. |
| Density | Depends on atomic weight of atoms or ions and their closeness of packing in crystal structure. Iron minerals and metals have high density. Covalently bonded minerals have more open packing and so have lower density. |
